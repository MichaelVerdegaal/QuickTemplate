# QuickTemplate

A python template to quickly start a new project. Comes with jupyter notebook and some 
pre-commit packages pre-provided.

## Installation

Installation is done with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (although pip is
possible too for fallback purposes). Note that installation requires access to
the Github repository where this package is located. A gitcredentials
authentication window should open when you call one of the install commands,
fill this in and the package will install.
